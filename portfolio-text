👤 About Me

I am YuvaSri M, a Software Developer with 2 years of experience in React and Python development. I specialize in building dynamic, responsive UI components, integrating backend services, and delivering AI-based intelligent solutions. My focus is on performance optimization, scalability, and user-centric design.

🔹 Key Skills

Frontend: React.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Redux, Ant Design, React Flow, React Router, Apex Charts

Backend & APIs: Python, Node.js, RESTful APIs, AI agents, LLM-based solutions

Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL

Cloud: AWS Fundamentals

🔹 Practical Scenarios
React Scenario – Performance Optimization

Challenge: A dashboard built with React and ApexCharts was slowing down due to frequent re-renders and heavy data processing.
Action:

Used React.memo and useCallback to reduce unnecessary re-renders.

Implemented virtualized lists for large data sets.

Optimized API calls with debouncing and caching.
Result: Improved rendering speed by 40%, resulting in smoother UI and better user experience.

Python Scenario – AI-Powered Query System

Challenge: Users struggled with writing SQL queries for a PostgreSQL database.
Action:

Built an LLM-powered AI agent that converts natural language queries into SQL.

Integrated error handling and schema validation for reliable results.

Used Python + FastAPI for backend and exposed endpoints to frontend.
Result: Reduced manual query writing efforts by 70% and empowered non-technical users to fetch insights easily.
